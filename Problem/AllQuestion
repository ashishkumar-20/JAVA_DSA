 Wap means write a java program 
 
1.)   Wap to find second largest element in the array ?
2.)   Wap to find unique element in the array ?
3.)   Given an array sorted in increasing order of size n and an integer x, find if there exists a pair in the array whose absolute difference is exactly x.(n>1)
4.)   Given an array of size n, find the total number of occurrences of given number x.  
5.)   Wap to reverse the given array ? 
6.)   Wap to sort Zeroes and ones in an array ? 
7.)   wap to Rotate the array by k steps where k is non negative number using Inplace method ?
