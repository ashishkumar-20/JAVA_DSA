Linked list is a linear data structure in which elements are not stored at continuous memory locations.
Linked list consist of two parts data parts and pointer ( reference or address ) of the next node .

Types of Linked list :
1) Singly Linked list
2) Circular Linked list
3) Doubly Linked list

Singly Linked list can be traversed in one direction only. last node of singly linked list  point to null.
Last node of circular linked list contains address of the head node or first node.
Doubly linked list can be traversed in both direction .

Advantage of Linked list :
Insertion and deletion is easy.
Due to Dynamic. 

Disadvantage of Linked list :
Takes more memory.
Random access of data is not possible. we have to access elements sequentially starting from the first node.
